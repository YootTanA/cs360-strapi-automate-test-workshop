### How to test things out?

Since most of students in this class use `yarn`, I'm going to use `yarn` in this project.
However, for those who use `npm`, you can try with `npm` and inform me if there are any problems

To begin you need to install all dependencies. 

`yarn install`

Then,

`yarn test`
